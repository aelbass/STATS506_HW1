# STATS506_HW1

# Created HW1 File and started working on the code

For Question 1: Part a, I imported the data file and read the header to make sure all data was imported fine.

Part b. I found the observations belonging to each sex by using the sapply function

part c. I found the weight category with the highest rings and then for that weight
I found the sex with the highest rings
I then found the row with the highest rings and the percentage of abalons with higher viscera weight than
shell weight

For part d. I split the data by sex then computed the correlation between each weight column and the rings 
for each sex and since all these attributes were given as columns, I transposed the table to get
rows as the sex and columns as the weight
